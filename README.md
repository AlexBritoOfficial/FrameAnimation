# FrameAnimation
Currently taking a course on Udemy.com called “The Complete Android & Java Developer Course - Build 21 Apps” and I just wrapped up the “Framed Animations” section. Learned some pretty cool animation tools in Java. Built a little animator. Afterwards, I took what I coded following along with the instructor instructed and made my own little version on an animated image.
